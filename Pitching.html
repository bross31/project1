		<p> Unleashed Pitching is the perfect place to come and train your baseball/softball
			skills in a controlled environment. All instructors have achieved a high pedigree
			through personal playing or coaching experiences. Learn the proper mechanics
			for pitching a baseball and softball. Baseball pitchers can learn effectively how to throw a
			fastball, change-up, curveball, sinker, and slider. Softball pitchers have the ability
			to learn a fastball, change-up, curve ball, screw ball, rise ball, drop ball, and
			drop-curve. Both baseball and softball pitchers will learn how to dominate the mound
			and gain a champions mindset; learn how and when to throw each type of pitch. The
			pitcher will learn how to command the zone and UNLEASH their true pitching potential!</p>
