			<p>Imagine a trio of individuals from Columbus, Ohio, buying a band name for $5,000 on a napkin in a Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar, and becoming the most decorated country band of all time. Gary LeVox, Jay DeMarcus, and Joe Don Rooney have amassed 17 #1 Hit Songs, 23.4 million albums sold, and over 40 trophies from the ACA, ACM, AMA, CMA, and People’s Choice awards. Over the past two decades the three individuals have traveled the world touring and sharing their infamous country hits, from starting at a Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in year the 2000 to their final farewell tour in 2020 being canceled from the Covid19 Global Pandemic. The first song the group ever performed together was Church on a Cumberland Road, their first song produced and released together was Prayin’ for Daylight in the year 2000.

			<p>Upon retirement from the band Rascal Flatts, the three artists have remained in contact with each other. With no band duties or responsibilities, the trio claims the communication between them is not as much or to the extent of what it was before, claiming its almost awkward. The three band mates explained it as after twenty years of communicating about the band and their responsibilities every single day, what do they talk about now? Ex-lead singer/vocalist, Gary LeVox, has gone on to release a solo Christian song on March 19th of 2021 and has made his plan very clear, as he pursues a “bucket-list” item, releasing a Christian based album. Guitarist, Joe Don Rooney, has explained that he is pursuing his passion of song writing, and is looking to collaborate with the top writers across music city. Finally, Jay DeMarcus, has moved onto focus on his Christian based music label he started in 2018, Red Street Records. Along with his record company, DeMarcus has released a solo song in tribute to his father and released a reality TV show on Netflix with his family, DeMarcus Family Rules.
